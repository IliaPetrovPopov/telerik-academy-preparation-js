Military scientists are training battle tanks using artificial intelligence. The first lesson is to teach them to move across the (x,y) - plane. They give them a sequence of moves and observe whether the tanks get to the correct (x, y) position on the field. This sequence is represented by string, and the character at position i represents the tank’s i-th move.

There are several commands – R – moves right, L – moves left, U – moves up and D – moves down.

To help the scientists, you have to write a program that collects the learning results of the tanks.
