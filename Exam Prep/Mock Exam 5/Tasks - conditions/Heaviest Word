The Academy needs you! We have this list of words and we have to find the heaviest one, but we haven't a clue how to approach the problem.

Word heaviness is determined by summing all the letters in it. The letter value corresponds to the position in the English alphabet - where a is 1 and z is 26. For example, the word alpha has a weight of 1 + 12 + 16 + 8 + 1 = 38.
Treat lower- and uppercase letters the same, so a and A both have the value 1.

Your task is to create a program that finds the heaviest word and prints its weight and the word itself to the standart output.

Input:
On the first line, N - the number of words to follow.
On the next N lines - a single word.

Output:
The heaviest weight and the heaviest word, separated by a space.

Constraints:
5 <= N <= 500
3 <= letters in a word <= 20
